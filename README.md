**Analyst Email:** 24f2008507@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

## Overview
This repository contains a professional **Beeswarm Plot** created using **RAWGraphs** to analyze employee salary distribution across different departments and experience levels. 

The visualization is designed for executive reporting, supporting compensation analysis, pay-equity assessment, and workforce planning.

## Business Context
Schulist Flatley, a strategic data-visualization consulting firm, required a detailed visualization that reveals salary variations across departments and highlights distribution patterns that traditional bar or pie charts cannot communicate effectively.

A Beeswarm Plot was chosen because it:
- Displays individual data points clearly
- Shows density and spread of salaries
- Preserves categorical grouping
- Supports compensation insights for leadership teams

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following fields:

- **department** – Categorical variable representing business unit  
- **level** – Employee experience level (e.g., Junior, Mid, Senior)  
- **salary** – Annual salary in USD  

The data was manually generated (15–20 rows) to simulate realistic compensation distributions suitable for visualization.
