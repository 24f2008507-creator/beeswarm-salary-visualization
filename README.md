**Analyst Email:** 24f2008507@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

## Overview
This repository contains a professional **Beeswarm Plot** created using **RAWGraphs** to analyze employee salary distribution across different departments and experience levels.

This visualization is designed for executive-level decision-making and supports compensation benchmarking, pay-equity analysis, and workforce planning.

## Business Context
A major client engaged Schulist Flatley to create a visualization that goes beyond simple bar or pie charts.

- **department** – Business unit  
- **level** – Employee seniority level  
- **salary** – Annual salary in USD  

A total of 15–20 records were used to simulate realistic corporate salary distributions.
