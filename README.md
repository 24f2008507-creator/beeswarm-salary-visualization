## Business Context  
A major corporate client needs to analyze:

- Salary distribution across departments  
- Variation by experience level  
- Pay gaps and equity patterns  
- Compensation compression risks  

A **Beeswarm Plot** is the ideal visualization because it shows **individual salaries**, **density patterns**, and **cross-department comparisons** more effectively than traditional charts.

The final chart will be used in:

- Annual reports  
- Board presentations  
- Strategic planning documents

## Dataset  
The dataset includes 15–20 realistic salary records with:

- **department** – categorical (Sales, HR, Engineering, Marketing, Finance)  
- **level** – categorical (Junior, Mid-level, Senior, Lead)  
- **salary** – continuous (annual compensation in USD)  

Example structure:

```csv
